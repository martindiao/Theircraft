# Theircraft

This is a Unity project I made to recreate some of the features in Minecraft.

All the resources (textures, sounds) are from Minecraft and owned by Mojang.

I use a library from https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer to read/write a Minecraft save file, so data structures are the same with Minecraft 1.12, but I have not read or copy any codes from Minecraft. What I do is read the Minecraft wiki and do experiments in Minecraft to figure out its mechanism.

Terrain generation has not been implemented so the game could not generate new chunks.

Unity version: 2021.1.12f1c1

## Implemented Features

CPU Ambient Occlusion

CPU Lighting

Crafting

Different Tools

Clouds

Day-Night Cycle

## Not Implemented Features

Terrain Generation

Multiple Saves

Multiplayer

Block Behavior

Monster Generation

Fog

Sun and Stars in skybox
